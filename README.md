# lithomap

## 2D geometry layout for lithography masks

A 2D geometry layout and visualization framework for creating lithography masks, with the ability to create wafer and chip *maps* for easy reference of the litho structures. The *map* is a cartoon version that may have distorted features but illustrates the shapes, dimensions, and annotations of the mask layout in a more comprehensible way.
